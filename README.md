### Closure Javascript
```javascript
function runningAverage() {
    let count = 0
    let accu = 0
    return function ( num ) {
        accu += num
        count++
        return Math.round( accu / count * 100 ) / 100
    }
}

var rAvgSol = runningAverage();
rAvgSol( 10 )
```

* vars count and accu are in the scope of the outer function
* its like a higher order function, accumulator pattern
* we can reset the accumulator by redeclaring rAvgSol
